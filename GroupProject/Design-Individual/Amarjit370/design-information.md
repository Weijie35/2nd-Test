\f0\fs24 \cf0 Design information for GroceryListManager\
1. A grocery list consists of items the users want to buy at a grocery store. The application must allow users to add items to a list, delete items from a list, and change the quantity of items in the list (e.g., change from one to two pounds of apples).\
* Defined a Item Class for an item.\
* Added attribute qty and unit in the Item class.\
* Defined a GroceryList class to represent the Grocery List.\
* Added an aggregated association between Item and GroceryList since the GroceryList contains one or multiple Items.\
* Added operation add, delete and update in the GroceryList class for doing add/delete and update operation. The update method also takes the quantity as the input so that it can update the list with the quantity for that item.\
* Added parmeter qantity and unit to the update operation. For eg the qty can be a integer and the unit will be unit of measurement for that item.(for eg, Pound/dozens/no etc)\
2. The application must contain a database (DB) of items and corresponding item types.\
* Added attribute name and type to the Item class.\
* The Database is not modeled explicity here but I want to define a PersistentStore class which will take care of saving and retrieving items to and from the data base.\
* Since quantity is not there for the inventory of items, creating a new class PersistentItem which will have 'is a' relation with the Itemclass.\
* Also created a CheckListItem which will have 'is a' relation with the Item class. Moved the qty and unit to CheckListIem.\
* Moved the aggregated association between Item and GroceryList to CheckListItem and GroceryList since we can only have the CheckListItem inside the GroceryList.\
3. Users must be able to add items to a list by picking them from a hierarchical list, where the first level is the item type (e.g., cereal), and the second level is the name of the actual item (e.g., shredded wheat). After adding an item, users must be able to specify a quantity for that item.\
* The first part is more of a UI requirement on how the list will be displayed to the user. I am assuming that the heirarchial list is progressively disclosed where they drill down on the type to get the list of item names for that item type.\
* I have added a get operation getItemTypes in PersistentStore which will return all the item types in the Database as a string so that UI can display the types\
* Added get operation getItemsByType in PersistentStore which will accept the type of the item as the parameter and will return the list of all the items for that type. Once user select a item type, the UI can call this method to get the items. Here I am returning Item array rather than String of item names because we might need to use that item to add it into the list.\
4. Users must also be able to specify an item by typing its name. In this case, the application must look in its DB for items with similar names and ask the users, for each of them, whether that is the item they intended to add. If a match cannot be found, the application must ask the user to select a type for the item and then save the new item, together with its type, in its DB.\
   * Once user types the name since it needs to fetch the item by name added the operation getItemsByName in the PersistenceStore class to look for items that matches the name. This will accept the parameter 'name' that is typed by the user. This will return the list of items back to the user alone with its name and type.\
   * Added operation getItemTypes to PersistenceStore so that, if user does not find the match, then UI can display all the available types and ask user to pick up the type for the new item.\
   * Added operation addItem to PersistentStore so that UI can call the method addItem by passing the name and type as parameter to add the list in to the Database.\
   * If the list need to be added as part of the GroceryList then the UI can call explcit operation to add the item to the List.\
5. Lists must be saved automatically and immediately after they are modified.\
* This requirement is on how the APIs will be called from the UI. This is not considered in the class design since it does not affect the design.\
6. Users must be able to check off items in a list (without deleting them).\
   * There should be a attribute isChecked on a item. Since this is applicable only for CheckListItem, added the attribute in the CheckListItem class.\
7. Users must also be able to clear all the check-off marks in a list at once.\
   * Adding operation clearAllChecked in GroceryList which can clear all the checked-off markes that are there in the list.\
8. Check-off marks for a list are persistent and must also be saved immediately.\
   * This requirement is on how the APIs will be called from the UI. The API to setChecked needs to be called on the CheckListItemwhen checkbox is clicked on the UI. This is not considered in the class design.\
9. The application must present the items in a list grouped by type, so as to allow users to shop for a specific type of products at once (i.e., without having to go back and forth between aisles).\
   * Added operation getItemTypes and getItemsByType on the GroceryList so that it can can be used by UI get the list of Items types and the items to be displayed by the UI.\
10. The application must support multiple lists at a time (e.g., \'93weekly grocery list\'94, \'93monthly farmer\'92s market list\'94). Therefore, the application must provide the users with the ability to create, (re)name, select, and delete lists.\
   * Since we want to support multiple List I defined a class GroceryListManager which has a contains relationship with the GroceryList so that we can support multiple list at a time\
   * Also Added a attribute name to the Grocery List to identity the list.\
   * Added operation create, rename and delete to the GroceryListManager\
   * Added an aggregated association between GroceryListManager and GroceryList since the GroceryListManager contains multiple GroceryList.\
11. The User Interface (UI) must be intuitive and responsive.\
   * Not considered since it is not part of a structural design and does not affect the design directly.}
